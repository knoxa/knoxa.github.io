# War Diary

These are some highlights from my exploration of the [war-diary](https://knoxa.github.io/war-diary/) corpus.

## Christmas 1914

The 11<sup>th</sup> Infantry Brigade diary appendix for [Christmas Day 1914](https://knoxa.github.io/war-diary/11-Bde/1914/1914-12-Appendix112.xhtml#xmastruce) includes a report on how the
truce developed in front of the 1st Battalion Hampshire Regiment<sup> [1]</sup>.

## Movements of the 4th Division

In August 1914 the 4<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division were pitched into the retreat from Mons, fought in the First Battle of the Marne, 
and took part the subsequent advance to the Aisne.
The movement tables for these periods are in the 11<sup>th</sup> Brigade war diary. 
These provide an interesting example of information extraction that I describe [separately](movements-4Div.md).
