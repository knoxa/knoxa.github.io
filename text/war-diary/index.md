# War Diary

These are some highlights from my exploration of the [war-diary](https://knoxa.github.io/war-diary/) corpus.

## Christmas 1914

The 11<sup>th</sup> Infantry Brigade diary [appendix for Christmas Day 1914](https://knoxa.github.io/war-diary/11-Bde/1914/1914-12-Appendix112.xhtml#xmastruce) includes a report on how the
truce developed in front of the 1st Battalion Hampshire Regiment<sup> [1]</sup>.
