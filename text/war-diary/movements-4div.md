# Movements of the 4sup>th</sup> Division

The 4th Infantry Division produced movement tables covering [the Retreat from Mons](https://knoxa.github.io/war-diary/11-Bde/1914/1914-08-Appendix10.xhtml)<sup> [1,2]</sup> 
and [the Advance to the Aisne](https://knoxa.github.io/war-diary/11-Bde/1914/1914-10-Appendix55.xhtml#movement)<sup> [3]</sup>.

In the 11 Bde war diary, the August movements<sup> [1]</sup> were photographed with a fold in the page that obscures a couple of lines.
I managed to find exactly the same source document in the 4 Div diary<sup> [2]</sup>, clearly photographed in its entirety. This raises the question of what to do
when a corpus includes multiple copies of the same source document. I've chosen to use the 4 Div copy to fill in the missing lines when transcribing the 11 Bde copy.
I've justified this by added the TNA reference for both source documents to the transcript. A transcript with more than one TNA source reference is therefore
assumed to derive from more than one source document.
