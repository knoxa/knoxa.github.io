# Semantic mark-up

My conventions for semantic mark-up ...

* Named entities: People, [Places](places) and Organizations.
* [Dates and Times](time.md)

Examples are drawn from the [War Diary](https://knoxa.github.io/war-diary/) corpus.

**Note**: I probably won't be rigourous about applying mark-up "rules". I probably won't be comprehensive either.
I'll focus my efforts on the documents that interest me. I'll develop and extend mark-up iteratively as I explore the documents.
How I use semantic mark-up will likely change as I explore.
