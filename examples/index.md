# Worked Examples

- **[Family Tree](family/workbook.xhtml)** - The Julio-Claudian family tree. This is (notionally) a multi-agent dialogue to extract knowledge (a family tree) from historical source text. Agents assert facts based on extracts from source text. These claims can be supported, contradicted or modified by other agents. The final consensus is a set of acceptable (and hopefully verified) claims that represent 'knowledge'.

- **[Chronology](chronology/example.xhtml)** - Events from Roman history. Agent assertions describe instants and intervals in time. I use these to derive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partial orders</a>.
