# My web pages

These web pages cover my experiments with knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR). If you're more interested in 'what' than 'how' you can start with the [worked examples](examples/index).

## Argumentation

I'm applying [argumentation theory](https://dstl.github.io/eleatics/doc/argumentation/) to the *reasoning* part of KRR. This is the topic of my [argumentation](https://github.com/knoxa/argumentation) repository. I also make good use of [Dstl eleatics](https://github.com/dstl/eleatics).

## Linked Text

I want to reason over information from text, with arguments grounded in source text justifying linked data models. This treats natural language text as a knowledge base, and is the subject of my [linked-text](https://github.com/knoxa/linked-text) repository.

## Data
