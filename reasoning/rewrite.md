# Rewriting claims

If we rewrite a claim, we create a new claim that has the same premises, and link the old claim to the new with an MA-Node.

We don't make the old claim a premise of the new because there may be cases where the original claim is unacceptable and the new claim isn't. For example, the claim as first made is ambiguous; and the rewritten claim clarifies it.
