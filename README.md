# My web pages

These web pages cover my experiments with knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR).

If you're more interested in 'what it does' than 'how it does it', you can start with the [worked examples](examples/index).

### Military History

See the [history](https://github.com/tigersmuseum/history) repository of the Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum and its [web pages](https://tigersmuseum.github.io/history/).
